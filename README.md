Password Manager with Auto-Generated Passwords
====================

This Python password manager allows users to save, view, and delete passwords securely. It also includes an option to auto-generate strong passwords of customizable length.

====================
Requirements
====================
1. Python 3.x
2. `cryptography` library (the script installs it automatically if missing)

====================
How to Run
====================

1. Run the script:
python3 password_manager.py (on Linux/macOS) 
python password_manager.py (on Windows)

2. The password manager will allow you to:
- Save new passwords.
- Generate passwords with a specified length.
- View saved passwords.
- Delete passwords.

====================
How It Works
====================
1. **Auto-Generated Passwords**: The user can generate a password with a length of their choice, which includes lowercase, uppercase, digits, and special characters.
2. **Password Management**: Passwords are encrypted and stored securely in a JSON file.
3. **Automatic Library Installation**: The script automatically installs the `cryptography` library if it's not installed.
